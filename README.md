# BPPS Instances Repository

This repository contains benchmark instances for the Bin Packing Problem with Setups (BPPS).

The instance set is associated with the research paper:

**"The Bin Packing Problem with Setups: Formulations, Structural Properties, and Computational Insights"**  
by R. Baldacci, F. Ciccarelli, S. Coniglio, V. Dose and F. Furini.

## üéØ Problem Overview

The Bin Packing Problem with Setups (BPPS) is a generalization of the classical Bin Packing Problem where items are partitioned into classes. When at least one item from a given class is packed into a bin, both a setup weight (reducing available capacity) and a setup cost are incurred. The objective is to determine a minimum-cost partition of items into bins such that:

- The total weight of items plus setup weights of active classes does not exceed bin capacity in any bin;
- The total cost ‚Äî including bin costs and class-specific setup costs ‚Äî is minimized.

This problem naturally arises in production planning and logistics applications where different item types require specific preparation or configuration steps.

In the referenced paper, we:

- Introduce a novel Integer Linear Programming formulation for this problem and analyze its LP relaxation properties;
- Propose a family of valid inequalities that strengthen the LP relaxation and improve the optimal worst-case performance;
- Derive theoretical upper bounds on the number of bins required, enabling significant problem size reduction;
- Establish a comprehensive benchmark of 480 instances and demonstrate substantial computational improvements through the integration of MCI and bin-number bounds.

## üè∑Ô∏è Instance Naming Convention

Instance files follow the naming pattern:
```
bpps_d{capacity}n{items}m{classes}w{min}_{max}s{min}_{max}f{flag}_seed{value}.txt
```

Where:
- `capacity`: Bin capacity value
- `items`: Number of items
- `classes`: Number of item classes
- `w{min}_{max}`: Weight range for items [min, max]
- `s{min}_{max}`: Setup weight range [min, max]
- `f{flag}`: Setup costs (0 = no setup costs, 1 = with setup costs)
- `seed{value}`: Random seed used for instance generation (0 or 1)

<br>

## üìÑ Instance File Format

Each instance file contains:

1. **Header line**: `{no. of items} {no. of classes} {bin capacity} {bin cost}`
2. **Class definitions** (one per class): `{setup cost} {setup weight} {item count}`
    - Setup costs are represented as negative values
3. **Item weights** (one per line): Items are ordered by class (all class 1 items, then class 2, etc.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Instance Generator

This repository includes a comprehensive instance generation toolkit in the [`generator/`](generator/) directory. The generator:

- **Follows BPPS naming convention**: Uses the standard `d{capacity}n{items}m{classes}w{min}_{max}s{min}_{max}f{flag}_seed{value}` format
- **Fully configurable**: All parameters can be customized via JSON configuration files
- **Command-line interface**: Easy-to-use CLI with various options
- **Statistics tracking**: Provides detailed generation statistics

### Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to generator directory
cd generator

# Generate instances with default parameters
python3 bpps_instance_generator.py

# Generate with custom configuration
python3 bpps_instance_generator.py --config configs/example_config.json

# Save default configuration template
python3 bpps_instance_generator.py --save-default-config my_config.json
```

For detailed usage instructions, see [`generator/README.md`](generator/README.md).
